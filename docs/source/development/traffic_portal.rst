**************

Introduction
============
Traffic Portal is an `AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_ client served from a `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ web server designed to consume the :ref:`to-api`. Traffic Portal is the official replacement for the legacy Traffic Ops UI.

Software Requirements
=====================
To work on Traffic Portal you need a \*nix (MacOS and Linux are most commonly used) environment that has the following installed:

	* `Ruby Devel 2.0.x or above <https://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=ruby-devel>`_
	* `Compass 1.0.x or above <http://compass-style.org/>`_
	* `Node.js 6.0.x or above <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_
	* `Bower 1.7.9 or above <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower>`_
	* `Grunt CLI 1.2.0 or above <https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli>`_
	* Access to a working instance of Traffic Ops

.. note:: The Traffic Portal consumes the Traffic Ops API. Modify traffic_portal/conf/config.js to specify the location of Traffic Ops.

Traffic Portal Project Tree Overview
=====================================
* **traffic_control/traffic_portal/app/src** - contains HTML, JavaScript and :abbr:`SCSS (Sassy CSS)` source files.

Installing The Traffic Portal Developer Environment
===================================================
#. Clone the `Traffic Control Repository <https://github.com/apache/trafficcontrol>`_
#. Navigate to the ``traffic_portal`` subdirectory of your cloned repository.
#. Run ``npm install`` to install application dependencies into ``traffic_portal/node_modules``. Only needs to be done the first time unless ``traffic_portal/package.json`` changes.
#. Run ``bower install`` to install client-side dependencies into ``traffic_portal/app/bower_components``. Only needs to be done the first time unless ``traffic_portal/bower.json`` changes.
#. Run ``grunt`` to package the application into ``traffic_portal/app/dist``, start a local HTTPS server (Express), and start a file watcher.
#. Modify ``traffic_portal/conf/config.js``:

	#. Valid SSL certificates and keys are needed for Traffic Portal to run. Generate these (e.g. using `this SuperUser answer <https://superuser.com/questions/226192/avoid-password-prompt-for-keys-and-prompts-for-dn-information#answer-226229>`_) and update ``ssl``.
	#. Modify ``api.base_url`` to point to your Traffic Ops API endpoint.
	#. Modify ``files.static`` to be ``./app/dist/public``.
	#. Modify ``log.stream`` to be ``./server/log/access.log``.

#. Navigate to http(s)://localhost:[port|sslPort defined in ``traffic_portal/conf/config.js``]
